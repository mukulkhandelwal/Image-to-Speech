Text extraction, detection and recognition
methods can be classified into three categories, texture-based,
connected component based and edge-based.

The texture
based methods analysis, based on Gabor filtering and wavelet
analysis.

Basically, the proposed Gabor filter based text
extraction method comprises three steps: edge detection using
Gabor Filter, Text area localization and text recognition. The
Steps of proposed algorithm an edge based method for Text
extraction in complex images and video frames using Gabor
filter described
